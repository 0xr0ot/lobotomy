# Lobotomy

Lobotomoy is an Android security toolkit with many features that automate different Android assessment and reverse engineering tasks.  The goal of the Lobotomy tookit was to provide a console environment, which would allow a user to load their target Android APK once then have all the necessary tooling without needing to exit that environment.  Lobotomy leverages and provides wrappers around other popular tools such as Androguard, apktook, Dex2Jar, and Frida.
